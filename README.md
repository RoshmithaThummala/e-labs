# e-labs
E-Labs is being developed for online assessments of doctors and patients, which includes the diagnosis of patients that are under doctors treatment for medical check up. The project mainly deals with registering the patient details and their tests with doctors references. Providing the commission to doctor according to tests taken by patient. E-Labs reduces administration time in processing the patient test costs and doctors commissions. What earlier could have taken 3 days, E-Labs does it in few minutes. More importantly, the administrator need not be IT savvy to use the system.
